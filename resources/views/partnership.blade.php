<p class="lead">
We have a partnership program which is open for anyone to join. To partner is to commit to give a certain amount monthly to the ministry. 


<p class="lead font-italic">
Phil 1: 3-5 (NIV)
3 I thank my God every time I remember you. 4 In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,
</p>

<p class="lead">
We have a service for the partners every two months where they get to meet the Pastor, share the word together, receive information about the current happenings in the ministry, share their testimonies, receive personalized prayer and also pray together.
</p>

<p class="lead">
The money given by partners is used to run the ministry. It is the money used to pay for the venue for the services, to pay rent for the RATC office, to fund missions, annual conferences expenses, baptism, communion and many other ministry expenses. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
We say a big thank you to all the partners who have faithfully given this far. Thank you to every new partner too. We bless God for you!
