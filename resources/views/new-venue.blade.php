RATC is moving to a new venue. We have been using different hired venues since RATC was birthed but now we need to settle down in our own venue. Our new venue will enable us to begin Sunday services and many other activities that we have been unable to undertake.

<p class="lead">
We have found a venue on Mombasa road. A beautiful space on 6th floor of Nextgen Mall. The idea is to own the space by the end of 8years.

It is an expensive venture so feel free to support us in any way you would be led to. The whole set up will cost us 26 Million Kenyan Shillings. Buying the place will cost us 100 Million Kenyan Shillings including set up costs. We are trusting God for provision. It is His work and He will provide.
