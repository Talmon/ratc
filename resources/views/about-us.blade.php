We have two services every week; every Monday and Thursday from 5.30pm to 8.30pm. We spend 30 mins in prayer, 30 mins in worship and the rest of the time is set aside for the word of God. Our main focus in the ministry is the word of God. We have seen the word totally transform many who come to the services.

Hebrews 4:12 (KJV)
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

We allow the Holyspirit to move in our services so we have seen and continue to see many filled with the Holyspirit, many delivered, many physical and emotional healings and many empowered by the Holyspirit to live their lives to the fullest.
